### ✅ Biometric Authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)

**What was implemented:**

   - Device compatibility check
   - Platform-specific biometric types (Face ID, Touch ID, Fingerprint)
   - Secure credential storage
   - Enable/disable functionality

2. **Auth Store Integration** (`stores/auth/authStore.ts`)
   - `loginWithBiometric()` - One-tap login
   - `enableBiometric()` - Enable after first login
   - `disableBiometric()` - Turn off in settings
   - State tracking: `biometricAvailable`, `biometricEnabled`

3. **Login Screen** (`features/auth/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`)
   - ✅ **Optional biometric button** - Only shows if user enabled it
   - Auto-prompt to enable after first successful login
   - Platform-specific icon (Face ID on iOS, Fingerprint on Android)
   - Seamless integration with existing login flow

4. **Settings Screen** (`app/profile/settings.tsx`)
   - Toggle switch to enable/disable biometric
   - Only visible if device supports biometrics
   - Security section with biometric control

**User Experience:**
```

3. User can accept or decline

Subsequent Logins (if enabled):
1. User opens app
2. Sees biometric button on login screen

   ✅ User restarts phone → Still logged in
   ✅ User clicks logout → Session cleared
   ```

3. **Security:**
   - Token validation on app resume
   - Invalid tokens auto-logout
