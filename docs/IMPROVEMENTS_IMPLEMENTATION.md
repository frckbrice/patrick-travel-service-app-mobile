## üíæ Enhanced Offline Mode with Advanced Caching

### Features Implemented:
- ‚úÖ Smart caching system with TTL (Time To Live)
- ‚úÖ Offline queue for pending operations
- ‚úÖ Automatic network status detection
- ‚úÖ Background sync when connection is restored
- ‚úÖ Cache size management and monitoring
- ‚úÖ Offline-first data fetching strategy
- ‚úÖ Retry mechanism for failed operations

### Service Created:
- `lib/services/offline.ts` - Complete offline service with caching and queue management

### Key Features:

#### 1. Smart Caching
```typescript
// Cache data with optional TTL
await offlineService.setCache('cases', casesData, 3600000); // 1 hour TTL

// Retrieve cached data (returns null if expired)
const cached = await offlineService.getCache('cases');
```

#### 2. Offline Queue
```typescript
// Add operations to offline queue
await offlineService.addToQueue({
  type: 'POST',
  url: '/api/cases',
  data: caseData
});
```

#### 3. Smart Fetching
```typescript
// Fetch with cache fallback
const data = await offlineService.fetchWithCache(
  'cases',
  () => casesApi.getCases(),
  3600000 // 1 hour TTL
);
```

#### 4. Network Status Monitoring
- Automatic detection of online/offline status
- Periodic connection checks (every 5 seconds)
- Toast notifications when status changes
- Automatic sync when connection is restored

#### 5. Cache Management
- Get cache size in bytes
- Clear all cached data
- Get cache statistics (size, item count, queue length)
- Automatic expiration of cached items

### Cache Strategy:
- **Default TTL:** 24 hours
- **Automatic expiration:** Cached items expire and are removed automatically
- **Offline-first:** App works seamlessly offline with cached data
- **Smart sync:** Changes made offline are queued and synced when back online

### User Experience:
- Seamless offline functionality
- Automatic data sync when connection is restored
- Toast notifications for connection status changes
- No data loss when offline
- Fast app startup with cached data
