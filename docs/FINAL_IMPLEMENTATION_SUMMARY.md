## 📦 Package Dependency Added

```json
"@react-native-community/netinfo": "^11.0.2"

## 🔧 Offline Service Updates

### Network Detection with NetInfo

**Before (Manual):**
```typescript
// Periodic fetch checks every 5 seconds
setInterval(() => {
  this.checkConnectionStatus();
}, 5000);
```

**After (NetInfo):**
```typescript
// Real-time network state monitoring
NetInfo.addEventListener(state => {
  this.isOnline = state.isConnected ?? false;
  
  if (wasOffline && this.isOnline) {
    this.processOfflineQueue();
  }
});
```

### Benefits of NetInfo:
1. **Real-time updates** - Immediate network change detection
2. **More reliable** - Doesn't rely on external API availability
3. **Better performance** - No periodic fetch requests
4. **Connection details** - Knows connection type (WiFi, cellular)
5. **Battery efficient** - Uses native system events
