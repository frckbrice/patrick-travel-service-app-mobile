# Chat & Notifications Implementation - Complete Flow

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the case assignment notification and chat initialization system for the Patrick Travel mobile and web application.

## Problem Statement
Previously, when an admin assigned a case to an agent on the backend dashboard, only the agent received a Firebase realtime notification. The client (case owner) was not notified about:
- Case assignment to an advisor
- Availability of chat functionality
- Who their assigned advisor is

This led to a poor user experience where clients didn't know when they could start communicating with their advisor.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Backend Enhancements

#### A. Firebase Chat Service (`/web/src/lib/firebase/chat.service.ts`)
**Purpose**: Manage Firebase Realtime Database chat conversations

**Key Functions**:
- `initializeFirebaseChat()`: Creates the Firebase chat structure when a case is assigned
- `sendWelcomeMessage()`: Sends an automated welcome message from the agent to the client
- `updateChatAgent()`: Updates agent information if a case is reassigned
- `deleteFirebaseChat()`: Removes chat data when a case is deleted

**Chat Structure**:
```javascript
chats/
  {caseId}/
    metadata/
      caseReference: string
      participants:
        clientId: string
        clientName: string
        agentId: string
        agentName: string
      createdAt: timestamp
      lastMessage: string
      lastMessageTime: timestamp
    messages/
      {timestamp}/
        senderId: string
        senderName: string
        senderRole: 'CLIENT' | 'AGENT'
        message: string
        timestamp: number
        isRead: boolean
```

#### B. Email Templates Service (`/web/src/lib/notifications/email-templates.ts`)
**Purpose**: Centralized email template management

**Templates Created**:
1. **Case Assignment Email**: Notifies client when an advisor is assigned
   - Professional HTML design with company branding
   - Advisor information clearly displayed
   - Call-to-action button to view case
   - Mobile app download reminder
   
2. **Case Status Update Email**: Notifies status changes
   - Visual status transition display
   - Optional advisor notes
   - Status-specific emoji indicators

3. **Document Status Email**: Notifies document approval/rejection
   - Clear approval/rejection messaging
   - Rejection reasons when applicable
   - Upload instructions for rejected documents

4. **Welcome Email**: Sent to new users
   - Getting started guide
   - Feature highlights
   - Quick action links

#### C. Updated Case Assignment Endpoint (`/web/src/app/api/cases/[id]/assign/route.ts`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive notification system on case assignment

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Old behavior: Only notified agent
await createRealtimeNotification(agentId, { ... });

// New behavior: Notify both agent AND client through multiple channels
await Promise.all([
  // 1. Agent web dashboard notification
  createRealtimeNotification(agentId, { ... }),
  
  // 2. Client web dashboard notification
  createRealtimeNotification(clientId, { ... }),
  
  // 3. Client mobile push notification
  sendPushNotificationToUser(clientId, { ... }),
  
  // 4. Client email notification
  sendEmail({ ... }),
  
  // 5. Initialize Firebase chat
  initializeFirebaseChat(...),
  
  // 6. Send automatic welcome message
  sendWelcomeMessage(...)
]);
```

**Notification Channels**:
1. **Web Dashboard (Agent)**: Firebase realtime notification
2. **Web Dashboard (Client)**: Firebase realtime notification
3. **Mobile App (Client)**: Expo push notification with navigation data
4. **Email (Client)**: Professional HTML email with case details
5. **Firebase Chat**: Auto-initialized conversation ready for messaging
6. **Welcome Message**: Optional automated first message from agent

### 2. Mobile App Enhancements

#### A. Case Update Monitoring Hook (`/mobile/lib/hooks/useCaseUpdates.ts`)
**Purpose**: Fallback mechanism to detect case updates if push notifications fail

**Features**:
- Polls for case updates every 5 minutes in background
- Immediately checks for updates when app returns to foreground
- Compares previous case state with current state
- Sends local notifications for:
  - New agent assignments
  - Case status changes
- Acts as a safety net if backend push notifications fail or are delayed

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Monitors two types of updates:
1. Agent Assignment: 
   - Detects when assignedAgent changes from null to a user
   - Sends notification: "Case Assigned! Your case REF has been assigned to AGENT"
   
2. Status Changes:
   - Detects when case.status changes
   - Sends notification: "Case Status Updated - now STATUS"
```

**Usage**:
Automatically activated in `app/_layout.tsx` when the app starts.

#### B. Enhanced Case Details Page (`/mobile/app/case/[id].tsx`)
**Purpose**: Show chat availability status to users

**Changes Made**:

1. **When Agent is Assigned** (Chat Available):
   - Highlighted advisor section with primary color background
   - Advisor name displayed prominently
   - "âœ… Chat available" badge
   - "Message Advisor" button enabled
   - Helpful hint: "ðŸ’¬ Chat with your advisor anytime"

2. **When No Agent** (Chat Not Available):
   - Warning-colored section showing "Awaiting Advisor Assignment"
   - Helper text: "Your case is being reviewed. An advisor will be assigned within 24-48 hours"
   - Disabled chat section with dashed border
   - Icon and message: "Chat Not Available Yet"
   - Description: "Chat will be available once an advisor is assigned. You'll receive a notification."

**Visual Design**:
- Uses consistent color scheme (COLORS.primary, COLORS.warning, COLORS.success)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Accessible and informative UI
- Smooth animations for better UX

#### C. Translation Support
**Files Updated**:
- `/mobile/lib/i18n/locales/en.json`
- `/mobile/lib/i18n/locales/fr.json`

**New Translation Keys**:
```json
{
  "cases": {
    "chatAvailable": "Chat available",
    "chatHint": "Chat with your advisor anytime",
    "chatNotAvailable": "Chat Not Available Yet",
    "chatNotAvailableDesc": "Chat will be available once an advisor is assigned...",
    "awaitingAssignment": "Awaiting Advisor Assignment",
    "assignmentHelper": "Your case is being reviewed. An advisor will be assigned..."
  }
}
```

### 3. Complete User Journey

#### Step 1: Client Creates a Case
1. Client submits a case through mobile app or web
2. Case is created with status: `SUBMITTED`
3. Client sees "Awaiting Advisor Assignment" message

#### Step 2: Admin Assigns Case to Agent
1. Admin logs into web dashboard
2. Navigates to cases and selects a case
3. Clicks "Assign" and selects an agent
4. **Backend triggers all notifications**:
   - âœ… Agent receives web dashboard notification
   - âœ… Client receives web dashboard notification
   - âœ… Client receives mobile push notification
   - âœ… Client receives email with advisor details
   - âœ… Firebase chat is initialized with metadata
   - âœ… Optional welcome message is sent from agent

#### Step 3: Client Receives Notification
**Mobile App**:
- Push notification appears: "ðŸ‘¤ Case Assigned! Your case REF-123 has been assigned to John Smith. They will contact you soon."
- Tapping notification navigates to case details
- Badge count updates

**Email**:
- Professional HTML email received
- Shows advisor name and case reference
- Includes "View Case Details" button
- Mentions chat feature availability

**Web Dashboard**:
- Notification bell shows new notification
- Toast/banner appears: "Your case has been assigned!"

#### Step 4: Client Opens Case Details
1. Case details page loads
2. **If agent assigned** (now true):
   - Highlighted section shows: "Advisor: John Smith"
   - Green badge: "âœ… Chat available"
   - "Message Advisor" button is enabled and prominent
   - Hint text: "ðŸ’¬ Chat with your advisor anytime"
3. Client clicks "Message Advisor"
4. Chat screen opens with initialized conversation
5. If agent sent welcome message, it's already visible

#### Step 5: Real-time Communication
1. Client and agent can now chat in real-time
2. Messages sync via Firebase Realtime Database
3. Both parties receive notifications for new messages
4. Unread counts update automatically

### 4. Fallback Mechanisms

#### Primary Channel: Push Notifications
- Expo Notifications API
- Real-time delivery
- Includes navigation data
- Platform-specific (iOS/Android)

#### Fallback 1: Local Polling
- `useCaseUpdates` hook runs in background
- Checks every 5 minutes
- Immediately checks on app foreground
- Sends local notifications if changes detected

#### Fallback 2: Email Notifications
- Always sent regardless of push notification status
- Provides complete information
- Includes direct links to app

#### Fallback 3: Manual Refresh
- Pull-to-refresh on cases list
- Manual navigation to case details
- Visual indicators update immediately

### 5. Error Handling

**Backend**:
```typescript
try {
  await Promise.all([notifications, chat, email]);
  logger.info('All notifications sent successfully');
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to send notifications', error);
  // Assignment still succeeds - notifications are best-effort
}
```

**Mobile**:
```typescript
try {
  await checkForUpdates();
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to check for updates', error);
  // Fails silently, will retry on next interval
}
```

### 6. Performance Considerations

#### Backend:
- Notifications sent in parallel using `Promise.all()`
- Non-blocking - assignment succeeds even if notifications fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Error handling doesn't block the main flow

#### Mobile:
- Polling only runs in background (not when app is active)
- Efficient comparison using reference tracking
- Minimal network requests (reuses existing API)
- Local notifications are lightweight

import { chatService } from '@/lib/services/chat';

// Mark single message as read
await chatService.markMessageAsReadApi('message-id-123');

// Mark all messages in chat room as read (when user opens chat)
await chatService.markChatRoomAsRead('case-id-123', userId);

// Mark multiple messages as read
await chatService.markMessagesAsReadApi(
  ['msg-id-1', 'msg-id-2', 'msg-id-3'],
  'case-id-123'
);
```

##### 3. Automatic Read Marking

When a user opens a chat conversation, all unread messages are automatically marked as read:

```typescript
// In chat screen component
useEffect(() => {
  if (caseId && userId) {
    chatService.markChatRoomAsRead(caseId, userId);
  }
}, [caseId, userId]);
```
