## 2025-10-30 — Notifications and Inbox classification fix

### Overview
Addressed inconsistencies between the Notifications tab and the Inbox/Sent tabs. Previously, Inbox could appear empty despite email notifications being present due to varying API shapes for sender fields. Implemented robust sender resolution and corrected filtering and rendering logic.

### Key changes
- File: `app/(tabs)/notifications.tsx`
  - Added `resolveEmailSenderId` to normalize sender detection across multiple API shapes: `senderId`, `sender.id`, `fromUserId`, `from.id`.
  - Updated Inbox/Sent filtering to use normalized sender ID:
    - Inbox: emails where sender ≠ current user.
    - Sent: emails where sender = current user.
  - Updated `renderEmailItem` to base unread styling on normalized sender logic.
  - Made date formatting resilient to `Date | string`.

### Resulting behavior
- Notifications tab: continues to show all backend notifications plus latest chat activity (unchanged intention).
- Messages tab: unchanged; shows chat conversations.
- Inbox tab: now correctly lists only received emails.
- Sent tab: lists only emails sent by the current user.

### Quality checks
- Lint clean on modified file.
- UI/UX preserved; logic-only improvement.
    
### Impact
Users now see received emails correctly in Inbox while still getting a comprehensive view in Notifications, resolving the mismatch and improving clarity across tabs.
